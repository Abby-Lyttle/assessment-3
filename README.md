# Assessment 2

You will be using your React skills in order to complete this todo list application. Redux is already wired up to work correctly, you just need to connect the wires variously throughout this application. 

Don't forget, actions get sent from React components to the Redux store in order to change state. Your buttons on the todo list application will have to behave as expected, and were expected in the Monday assessment.

**Things to do!**

1) Create a component representing a Task. 
2) Use the "taskListArr" in the App.js file in order to loop through and create multiple of these components.
3) Wire up the "complete" and "remove" buttons on the Task using the Redux slice. 
    3.1) Hint: Dispatch an ACTION from the React component.
4) Success.
